## Dallas lab

We are a group of theory-minded ecologists doing work on population, community, and disease ecology. We use a combination of approaches, including leveraging existing data resources, developing theoretical models, and performing laboratory microcosm experiments.

### On our Github...

We use GitHub to develop collaborative scientific projects, and to serve as a common environment to organize lab efforts. For instance, we have 

+ [project template](https://github.com/dallasLab/project-template) which can serve as a starting point for developing research projects
+ [poster template](https://github.com/dallasLab/UofSC_poster_template) for presenting research at scientific conferences (LaTeX)
+ [presentation template](https://github.com/dallasLab/labLogistics/tree/master/beamerTemplate) for presenting talks (LaTeX/beamer)
+ [other useful LaTeX documents](https://github.com/dallasLab/labLogistics/tree/master/bstFiles) for formatting citations based on some of the journals we often submit to
+ [lab organization documents](https://github.com/dallasLab/labLogistics) including our [code of conduct](https://github.com/dallasLab/labLogistics/blob/master/codeOfConduct.md), [lab wiki](https://github.com/dallasLab/labLogistics/blob/master/wiki.md), and [my mentoring philosophy](https://github.com/dallasLab/labLogistics/blob/master/mentoring.md)
+ [lab safety documents](https://github.com/dallasLab/labLogistics/tree/master/SAFETY) detailing information on hazards in the lab, emergency contact numbers, chemical inventory, and other logistics relevant to our benchwork.
